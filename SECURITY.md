## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please email our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) or use the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/security/advisories/new) feature.

We aim to acknowledge your report within 3 business days and provide a more detailed response within 7 business days, including our assessment and next steps.

After triage, we will keep you informed of the progress and notify you when the vulnerability has been addressed or if it is not accepted as a security issue. We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.
